      - role: Engineering Intern
        time: May - August, 2023
        company: Cleo Robotics, Boston Seaport, MA
        details: |
            • As an Engineering Intern at Cleo Robotics, a contribution made to the entire team was the design and 
            implementation of an enhanced organized sub-assembly system. This system facilitated the efficient and rapid 
            construction of drones, ultimately reducing assembly time. 
            • This achievement was made possible by leveraging skills such as effective time management, a keen 
            organizational perspective, proficiency in soldering, and the application of other relevant capabilities.
            • During the time at Cleo, multiple responsibilities were assigned, including the production and implementation of 
            various methods to refine drone assembly efficiency and the repair of damaged drones. 
            • The outcomes achieved stemmed from the utilization of tools such as SolidWorks and 3D Printing, as well as the 
            capacity to multitask and the acquisition of other pertinent skills necessary to accomplish the assigned tasks.

projects:
    title: Phase Difference
    intro: >
        Developed MATLAB code to successfully identify points on each waveform with the ability to perform 
        calculations to determine the phase difference between two waveforms with a 95% accuracy.
        Constructed a circuit and exported CSV file measurements taken with the Analog Discovery into MATLAB

    title: Water Detector
    intro: >
        Designed a water detector system that detects water on a flat surface and numerous depths using LED’s and 
        probes, applied an audible alarm that would sound when a critically set depth was reached (could be changed 
        based on user preference)
        Tested the design and corrected errors by researching for more useful components to be added into the circuit.
